FIAT-NFT is a project which allows users to buy NFTs with their CREDIT CARDS while at the same time allowing sellers to be paid in cryptocurrencies. 
I used Chainlink PriceFeed Aggregator to convert ONE token price to USD. 

To begin project:
1. Create an env modeled on env-sample
2. Install dependencies in both the root and the client folder
3. Compile truffle project and migrate it
4. Got to client folder and run npm start
